I am Sarah Naghi.

Technology was always my passion. I have a Bachelor degree in information technology with a 
field of specialization in software engineering.

I graduated from King Abdulaziz university June 2022 with an honor degree. During my study I 
was able to complete a lot of projects with different programming languages. 

I trained in the Emergency and disasters center at King Abdulaziz University. It is an integrated 
center within the university equipped with the appropriate technologies and capabilities to deal 
with emergencies and disasters in all its stages. During that time, using flutter and dart I worked 
to make an application for early warnings and disaster preventions. The application aims to
minimize human and material losses, raise the university's readiness to reduce the risks it is 
exposed to and recover from its effects. After two months it was ready for launching and could
be downloaded on any android device. 

In my senior year, I worked to make an application using amazon cloud. The application collects
patients records in one place instead of each hospital having its own record.
This cloud could be shared between hospitals using a website. The goal was to save patients 
who do not have medical files or records. 

After my graduation, I started training at Dar al Saaed information technology company.
I worked with Laravel PHP to make a responsive e-commerce website.
My goal is to have knowledge and experience in technology and web development.
Make a positive and direct beneficiation, I am positive that technology will make a difference in the 
future and my goal is to be a part of it.
